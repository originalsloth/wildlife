## Getting started
Every plugin consists of at least three parts:

[configuration]   /includes/config/{plugin-name}.php

[display]         /includes/display/{plugin-name}.php

[functions]       /includes/functions/{plugin-name}.php
    
## Configuration
Configuration files are **Required**!
Without them the plugin all requests will be ingored.

They control everything from database credentials to page titles.
There purpose it to make installation and migration easier.

/includes/config/global.php will be called with
every page.
